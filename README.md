# BIUST REVISION AI APP

Welcome to my side project to keep me busy and stop from going insane - we are on a semester break.

Anyway, I've always wanted to create my own custom AI app that fits into my workstyle when I'm studying. Therefore I'm building it in Dart for the backend and for the frontend in React.

> The motto is not to create a web app, but to create an installable using tools like Tauri and DroidScript for mobile.

> Here is an upto-date snapshot of the website;

## Feature's I'm Hoping To Implement Soon:

-   Community Mode, where students can ask for help and questions
-   Document Archive, students can browse for past papers and upload them too.
-   A scheduler + event tracker for personal help
-   Classes page, a student creates a class and has a common page to get help with that subject in more detail, it will be a habour for their notes, and anything related to revision

## Contributing

-   The library being used is as close to vanilla js, all it is is a css in js function and an object that helps create elements similar to `document.createElement`, more info can be found at; [viewkit-ui](https://github.com/oarabilekoore/viewkit-ui/blob/main/INTRO.md)

-   Contributing is open to anyone, no restrictions too.

## License

MIT Licensed project other universities can clone too.
